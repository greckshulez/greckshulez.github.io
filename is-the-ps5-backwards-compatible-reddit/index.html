<p>The PS5 picks up that there is a keyboard plugged in but it only registers very few keys such as windows and right alt. The PS5 will also play both digital and disc-based titles he added meaningPS4 and PS VR users with an extensive collection of physical games can play them on the new console. The ps3 was built on a completely different architecture than the ps4 the ps5 and ps4 have a similar architecture due to which ps4 games can be simulated on a virtual bus in the ps5. Hey guys I grew up on ps2 and ps3 games but decided to swap to Xbox because how well there handling backwards compatibility do you see PS5 ever. The Top 100 thing is just what theyd tested.

<p>The PS5 console is backwards compatible with the overwhelming majority of PS4 games. Mark Cerny the brains behind the PS4 filed the patent that could provide the backwards compatibility on PS5. No backwards compatible games are nearly as fast as titles coded to take explicit advantage of PS5. AFAIK PS5 cant reed CDs so that rules out backward comparability with disks for PS1 and some PS2 games. I really want to play Persona 5 which surprise surprise Xbox has no games like that hence the switch. Image Ps5 Backwards Compatibility Info R Ps4.</p>
