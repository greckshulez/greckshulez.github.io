<p>However there is a workaround for fans adamant about using their DualSense with the PlayStation 4 anyway. I changed to the PS5 version and regret it as you lose the ability to play with friends on PS4 on UT. I am curious if they will have a new PS5 version of warzone once the new update comes out but I havent heard much about it in that regard. Plug your DualSense controller into your PC and begin Remote Play with your PS4 and youll be able to control your PS4 with the PS5 controller. The DualSense can connect to a PC either wired or through Bluetooth and you can use PS4 remote play on your PC.

<p>Unfortunately you cannot use a DualSense PS5 controller on PS4. The PS4 and DualShock were designed to be proprietary so that the system only recognized specific types of controllers which is why the PS4 cannot recognize the PS5s DualSense. PS5 im only guessing here but i think DualSense will work just fine on PS4 games but they might not make use of the haptic feedback. Can you use a PS5 controller with PS4. Well how to use PS5 controller on PC. Ps5 Dualsense Controller And Accessories Price Details Announced Polygon.</p>
