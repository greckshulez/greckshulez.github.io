<p>Considering NASCAR tracks are already lit up the headlights are removed to reduce the weight on the stock car and allow more spacelighter weight. The situation is more common at the end of a long straightaway. Sometimes the deceleration experienced during braking is greater than that experienced during a collision in such cases an air bag will be useless. With no light lenses to break during collisions there is no glass on the track to puncture other cars tires. Yes its because some point someone shut off the automatic headlights stupidest invention ever IMO and the driver is too stupid to realize hurr durrr its not bright outside. Why Do Nascar Cars Use Stickers Instead Of Headlights Quora.</p>

<p>Daytime Running Lights. NASCAR race cars frequently bump into each other during a race. Decals are cheaper and lighter than headlights they make the car look like a real stock car and dont shatter when bumped keeping glass off. It means they are readying the electrical power for the hybrid engine which will convert heat and wheelspin to electrical energy. The headlights are taped to prevent or reduce glass pieces falling on the track in case of the headlight breaking due to a minor impact or vibration etc. Lightning Mcqueen S Headlights In The First Movie Were Just Decals Because He Didn T Need Them For The Piston Cup But In Cars 2 He Got Actual Headlights So That He Can Race.</p>

<p>The dash lights dont turn off. Why do race cars not have airbags. Why dont F1 cars have airbags. It helps to different between the prototypes and the production cars when they are approaching you from the rear. The differences in cars were easily identifiable by the body shape headlights taillights and engine. Miata Splitter Eunos Roadster Na Mazda Mx5 Miata Miata Miata Mx5.</p>

<p>A lot of guys who race the older Porsche 911s take out the right headlight because the oil cooler is in the right fender well behind the headlight. The safety in modern F1 cars is more than enough. Sometimes the deceleration experienced during braking is greater than that experienced during a collision in such cases an air bag will be useless. The F1 cars have an orange light on their backside which blinks to let the driver behind know that the one in the front is charging the battery system. A Ford would race a Chevy or a Dodge would race a Toyota. Pin By Bri Gray On Drag Racing Drag Racing Cars Drag Cars Mustang.</p>
