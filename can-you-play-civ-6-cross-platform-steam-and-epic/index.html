<p>Sid Meiers Civilization VI does not support cross-platform play. It seems like it was supported at some point in the past but was it discontinued at the same time that Civ V lost. It was just announced that the game supports cross-cloud saves on Steam and Nintendo Switch as long as you link your 2K account. This should be a simple question to answer but I cant find a definite current answer online anywhere. Luckily for Civilization 6 players there is crossplay available between copies purchased from Steam and those purchased or gotten for free from the Epic Games Store.

<p>Can Mac and Windows play multiplayer together. Is if you look in Multiplayer theres a new mutliplayer game option that says Unified PC play. If you dont accept you can only play with other Steam players that havent enabled crossplay. Can you play Civ 5 between Mac and PC. When joining the multiplayer menu youll be asked if you want to enable crossplay. Civilization Vi For Linux Updated With The Spring Update No Cross Platform Multiplayer Yet Gamingonlinux.</p>
