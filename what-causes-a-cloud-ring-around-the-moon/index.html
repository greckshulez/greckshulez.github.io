<p><strong>What Causes A Cloud Ring Around The Moon</strong>, According to the National Weather Service this ring of light which is actually an optical illusion forms around the moon when moonlight refracts off ice crystals in cirrus clouds high up in the Earths atmosphere. Known as a moon ring a winter halo or a 22-degree halo its when ice crystals suspended high above in thin wispy cirrus clouds refract the moons light to. Lunar halos are quite rare and occur most often during the winter months.</p>
