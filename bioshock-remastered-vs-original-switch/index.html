<p>Bioshock Remastered for the Nintendo Switch is nothing short of an incredible experience. Comparisons with Xbox One X also show it using the updates settings - including improved FOV - giving it an advantage over the last-gen originals. Sound is obviously more compressed compared to the original reverb is missing and even some of the smaller sound effects are absent such as the tape reel noise on playing back a diary recording. Nintendo Switch handles all three BioShock games superbly using a dynamic 1080p resolution to allow for a typically 30fps level of performance.
