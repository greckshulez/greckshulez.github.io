<p>Ukrainian studio 4A Games had developed three video games set in the universe. As he points out although the original did have horror elements it was basically a straight action title but thats not what the sequel is going to. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts. It might be because Im used to the creatures in the Metro games now but the only real scary thing about the game is some of the creatures. Metro 2033 was not very scary though there are parts that make you want to get out as soon as possible because of the threats in the area. Metro 2033 Videogiochi Shopping Video.</p>

<p>So I investigated but not too much because I didnt want to get spoiled on the story. This games central theme is a first-person shooting but it has some horror and survival elements. Metro Exodus looks wonderful and if I were to buy it Id first want to the start from the beginning of the series and play the first two games. If youre not too bothered by the music ambient sounds and other. Otherwise the horror they focus on is a more supernatural type where it tries to mess with your head with people. .</p>
