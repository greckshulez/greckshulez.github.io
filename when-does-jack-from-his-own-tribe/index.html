<p>In Lord of the Flies what does Jack tell his new tribe. This act represents the fact that Ralphs diminished group has lost the power to start fires and get rescued which symbolizes the fact that their link to civilization is totally lost. I feel that Jack uses the idea of the beast to control his tribe by assuring everyone that the existence of the beast was true. Most of the older boys except Samneric.

<p>From the beginning of the novel Jack and Ralph both want to be leader of the boys and disagree not only about who the leader should be but what style of leadership is most effective. I feel that Jack uses the idea of the beast to control his tribe by assuring everyone that the existence of the beast was true. This act represents the fact that Ralphs diminished group has lost the power to start fires and get rescued which symbolizes the fact that their link to civilization is totally lost. Simon witnesses the killing and staking of the pig from his secret spot in the glade. Jack begins acting ever more like a cruel dictator to his own tribe members having one of the boys tied up and beaten for angering him.
