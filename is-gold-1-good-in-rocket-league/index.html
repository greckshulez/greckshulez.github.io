<p>Hoodyhooo here and this is the Gold section of my Rocket League progression guide. Gold 300 500 hours 300-400 hours into playing a game and you have reached the top 50 of players in ranked. They will often allow you to win an aerial challenge even if your opponent goes up first and offers a pretty massive advantage in gold ranks where a lot of players are still using single jump aerials. Level 1 11m Top Blokes Fan If youre a brand new player then I feel like youre way too high of a rank. As you can also see the majority of players finish a Rocket League season somewhere between Gold 1 and Platinum 1. An Experience With Rocket League.</p>

<p>Reaching Gold is a milestone that tends to drive players to the next level. Champion I Division IV means that you are in the fourth Division of Champion I. It only gets harder and more time-consuming to progress from here. You can use it intentionally in a few situations where you want to pop the ball over your opponent but not totally commit to the shot. A high percentage of goals in Rocket League are conceded when defenders cant get back in time to make a save. I Made Grand Versions Of Every Rank Set Minus Plat And Champ R Rocketleague.</p>
