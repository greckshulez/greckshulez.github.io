<p>Posted by 3 years ago. Unfortunately Gamestop isnt going to take any systems that dont have the power and audiovideo cords as well as a working controller. Be straight with them and tell them exactly what doesnt work and theyll tell you what you can get for it. Never had an issue with a standard xbox one controller and I have kids that play for hours on them. Pretty good deal IMO. So Stoked I Got It For 33 After Trading In The Controller That Came With My Bundle Right Now On Sale For 55 At Gamestop R Xboxone.</p>
