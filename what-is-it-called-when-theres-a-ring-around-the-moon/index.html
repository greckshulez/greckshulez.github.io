<p><strong>What Is It Called When Theres A Ring Around The Moon</strong>, There isnt really a ring about the Moon. A lunar halo also known as a 22-degree halo is a hazy ring that occurs at a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the moonIt is the result of the moons light being refracted by ice crystals in Cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere at an altitude of approximately 6000 meters 20 000 feet. Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere.</p>
