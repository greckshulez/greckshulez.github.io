<p>Forza Motorsport 3 is where dreams are driven. For me Forza 4 was an all around good Forza. Were dusting off all of our favorite 360 driving games. Even though it is almost a sure thing Forza Motorsport 3 4 and Horizon will be signed up in the backwards compatibility program there is a reason to be afraid about pur gamesaves.
