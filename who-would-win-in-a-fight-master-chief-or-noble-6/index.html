<p>But if Cortana was out of his jack Six and the Master Chief would have a hard time fighting and defeating one another. I am the biggest supporter of Noble Six and I think he would put up a great fight but Chief is the spartan to beat him. Theyre both extremely skilled and deadly combatants but Chief has far and away proven that he has the skills to survive even when the odds are stacked against him. Though Masterchief seems like the brute force taking point on a huge assault type of guy while noble 6 seems more like a spec ops behind enemy lines type of guy i mean they even describe noble 6 as doing ALOT of lone wolf stuff.

<p>As such the Master Chief wins overall with a 2-0 victory. Anyone could fight master chief BUT noble six would offer master chief the fight of his life. It would be a long epic and brutal battle but in ten fights the Chief will walk out of there with six hah or more wins.
