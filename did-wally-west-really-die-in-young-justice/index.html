At the beginning of the chapter everyone thought that wally was really dead but before the end of the chapter it was revealed that everything Artemis saw was an illusion cast by mgann and zatanna for me that is To give hope that Wally is still alive what I want to get to is that if a producer of a series decides to kill a character in his series the producer decides that he will.

<p>Season 3 of Young Justice found Artemis sharing a house in Star City with Will Harper and her niece Lian. Yet as fans gear up for Young Justice. He seemingly died himself but returned after it was revealed that his love for Linda was a tether between the Speed Force and the real world. Barry and Bart were fast enough to dodge the beams from that energy. Jason ToddRobin - Died of an unknown cause presumably beaten to death by Joker with a crowbar.

<p>No offences but Im kinda sure you would not say that if someone other than Wally West had died more or less in a similar way they also killed him because he was the fandom most loved just like JK Rowling murdered characters like Remus Lupis and Sirius Black this is has done many times so I dont see why everybody should be surprised. Edited by Ashcat19 0 Ashcat19 3242013. At first Artemis insisted that she was just trying to help raise the. Nowhere was that clearer than with Wally Wests death in the second season finale. The death of Wally West as Kid Flash is arguably the biggest game-changer in the history of Young Justice despite the fact that the show ended its original run in the same episode that saw him die.

<p>My idea is that when Wally West fades from existence what really happens is that he was actually transported through time and space into another universedimensiontimeline call it what you want. It was the opposite. While the Helmet was kept safe Kent died defending it. If what has happened on screen on Young Justice so far is to be taken as the final say on the matter then yes. Well i still dont think he died due to speedsters always somehow being able to disintegrate into the speed force.
