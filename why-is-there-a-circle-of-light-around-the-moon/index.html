<p><strong>Why Is There A Circle Of Light Around The Moon</strong>, A lunar halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. In a number of cases its actually Cloud Rainbow and sometimes other Nature Nymphs painting the dark nocturnal sky canvas.</p>
