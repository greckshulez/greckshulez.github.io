<p>This retrofit can often be confusing and adding. Ive purchased a genuine set of mercedes clk w209 xenon headlights to replace my halogen headlights. You can probably find a HID headlight assembly on Ebay for about 300 but you would still need the bulb and the ballast.</p>

Either can have washers although xenon must and all headlights cycle to reset the stepper motor position. Greatbi-Xenon lamp is working fine. This could mean a large bill at the garage as well as purchasing the headlight assemblies themselves. Because they are engineered to match standard halogen.</p>
