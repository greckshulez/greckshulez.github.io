<p>On a clear winter night these halos can sometimes also be seen surrounding a full moon as well and are known as a Moon Ring or a Winter Halo. So I researched this for an explanation and here is the Folklore interpretation. The rainbow or halo around the Moon appears due to the ice and dust particles from the atmosphere. This sign happens right before the seven-year tribulation period also known as the great day of His wrath Revelation 617. Then I looked up the scientific interpretation and it said Clouds moving in cold front off shore high winds and hailstorm.
