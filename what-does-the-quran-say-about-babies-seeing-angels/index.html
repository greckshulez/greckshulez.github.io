<p>1678 It is easy for us as human beings to forget that. 1 That what is meant is the people of his own time ie that whoever saw him in a dream and had not migrated Allah would enable him to migrate and to see him with his own eyes when he was awake. He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. TLDR Most religions that believe in angels would say yes angels can see humans. The Quran mentions a few rare instances where humans see angels as in the case of Mary mother of Jesus peace be upon them who speaks to an angel who appears to her like a man.
