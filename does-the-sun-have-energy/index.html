<p><strong>Does The Sun Have Energy</strong>, It also have a high potential energy contained in the electro-static bound subatomic particles and in the gravitational forces within the sun. Solar energy is essential to agriculture cultivating. When the energy emitted by the sun reaches the orbit of a planet the large spherical surface over which the energy is spread has a radius d P equal to the distance from the sun to the planet.</p>

<p>Like most stars the sun is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium atoms in a plasma state. The amount of solar energy that Earth receives has followed the Suns natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs with no net increase since the 1950s. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past half-century. The sun generates energy from a process called nuclear fusion.

<p>Four hydrogen nuclei fuse to become one helium atom. By fusion the sun burns about 564 million tons hydrogen per second resulting in 5597 million tons of helium. The Sun is the source of most of the energy that drives the biological and physical processes in the world around usin oceans and on land it fuels plant growth that forms the base of the food chain and in the atmosphere it warms air which drives our weather. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past half-century.

<p>Every 15 millionths of a second the Sun releases more energy than all humans consume in an entire year. In the UK that is 380 quadrillion Joules every second and in short scale numbers it would be 380 septillion Joules. The sun generates energy from a process called nuclear fusion. Every day the sun radiates or sends out an enormous amount of energy. The rest of the sun is heated by the energy that is transferred from the core through the successive layers eventually reaching the solar photosphere and escaping into space as sunlight or the kinetic energy of particles.

Plants produce food using sunlight and the food we get from plants and animals also has its primary sunlight source. None would exist without it.

<p>On average even after passing through hundreds of kilometers of air on a clear day solar radiation reaches Earth with enough energy in a single square meter to run a mid-size desktop computerif all the sunlight could be captured and converted to electricity. During nuclear fusion the high pressure and temperature in the suns core cause nucleito separate from their electrons. By fusion the sun burns about 564 million tons hydrogen per second resulting in 5597 million tons of helium. The source of the suns energy is Nuclear Fusion Basically the heat generated within the sun causes the nuclei which would normally repel one another because they both have a positive charge to bang into one another and fuse.

<p>Four hydrogen nuclei fuse to become one helium atom. The sun generates energy from a process called nuclear fusion. While people have not been around that long they have been using solar energy in a variety of ways for thousands of years. On average even after passing through hundreds of kilometers of air on a clear day solar radiation reaches Earth with enough energy in a single square meter to run a mid-size desktop computerif all the sunlight could be captured and converted to electricity. The rate of energy coming from the Sun changes slightly day to day. Did You Know These Sun Gazing Benefits Gazing Self Improvement Tips Improve Immune System.</p>

<p>The heat from the sun creates convection currents that cause winds to blow and generate ocean currents. The rate of energy coming from the Sun changes slightly day to day. Each year as of 2010 the world is estimated to use 5 x 1020 Joules of energy. But dont worry its only 00000000000000000002 percent of the suns entire mass. None would exist without it.

<p>Without the Sun there would be no light no warmth and no life. The loss of mass about 43 million tons per second is transformed into energy. Without the Sun there would be no light no warmth and no life. The enrgy for sun comes through Nuclear Fusion. Each year as of 2010 the world is estimated to use 5 x 1020 Joules of energy.
