<p>What causes a ring around the Moon. The shape of the ice crystals causes the moonlight to be focused into a ring. This ring surrounding the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight which is really reflected sunlight of course through ice crystals suspended in the upper atmosphere between 5-10 km in. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. Cirrus and cirrostratus clouds are often precursors for storm clouds behind them because they are most often the first cloud layer seen when a weather system approaches.

Cirrus and cirrostratus clouds are often precursors for storm clouds behind them because they are most often the first cloud layer seen when a weather system approaches. One weather folklore says a ring around the moon means precipitation soon because high cirrus clouds often come before a storm. When the Moon formed some 45 billion years ago it was spinning much more rapidly than it is today. Tidal Locking is the reason why do we see only one side of the moon The simple answer is that we only see one side of the moon because the moon rotates around the Earth at the exact same angular speed in fact its not exactly true well talk about it later too as it rotates around its own axis so that the same side of the moon is constantly facing the surface.
