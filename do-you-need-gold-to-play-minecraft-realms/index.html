We do have two realms that we play on a regular basis one being a faction like SMP server and a creative city world where we build beautiful things and if we are bored we play mini games on servers. Realms are personal multiplayer servers run by Minecraft just for you and your friends. What you do on your server is up to you.

<p>Note Youll also need an Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Realms on an Xbox console and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription when playing Realms on a Nintendo Switch.

<p>No you dont need Realms for cross-play. The biggest thing to remember is that you can play Minecraft with anyone who owns the same version as you. Realms requires paid subscription sold separately. This includes Minecraft for the Xbox 360. Minecraft on the Xbox 360 supports splitscreen and if you have one Gold account other people playing on the same console can participate online without needing Gold accounts of their own as long as they are logged in as.
