To escape the tower Daedalus crafted wings for himself and his son using feathers from the birds that frequented the tower and wax from the candles. He was a skilled craftsman and inventor and his nephew Talos was his apprentice so good that it gave his uncle a complex. Daedalus was imprisoned in a tower with his son Icarus by King Minos because he had aided Theseus on his mission to kill the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. The legend Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minoss daughter Ariadne a clew or ball of string in order to help Theseus the enemy of Minos to survive the Labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.

<p>Firstly when Minos was claiming the throne of Crete after the death of the King of Asterion husband of his mother Europa Minos asked for help from the god Poseidon. Daedalus was imprisoned in a tower with his son Icarus by King Minos because he had aided Theseus on his mission to kill the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. Soon however Daedalus fell into disfavour of the King of Crete The two most popular versions as to why Daedalus incurred the wrath of King Minos are. Unfortunately for Daedalus the King had imprisoned him and his young son Icarus in a high tower so that they couldnt reveal the secret of the labyrinth to anyone. Furthermore why was Daedalus and Icarus imprisoned. Pin On 2nd 6th Century History.</p>

<p>He was imprisoned with his son Icarus. Daedalus was imprisoned in a tower with his son Icarus by King Minos because he had aided Theseus on his mission to kill the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. Daedalus left his wings at the altar of Apollo because theres no use in flying anymore since his son Icarus died. The Oracle channeling the words of the Gods instructed him to have the maze built. In the Labyrinth Daedalus tried to find ways to escape from Crete. Pin On B L O O D O F T H E P O E T S.</p>
