As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere. Cirrus and cirrostratus clouds are often precursors for storm clouds behind them because they are most often the first cloud layer seen when a weather system approaches.

The hazy rings appear at a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the moon vary from rainbow-colored to a pale white color depending on the level of refraction size of the clouds strength of the moonlight. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. This is about the distance of your fist held at arms length.
