<p>Sun halos are generally considered rare and are formed by hexagonal ice crystals refracting light in the sky 22 degrees from the sun. Down to the left and right there is also a trace of the rare 46 halo. On the afternoon of April 28 a solar halo spectacle was staged in the main urban area of Chengdu Sichuan Province with colored halos surrounding the sun.</p>
<h3 id="on-rare-occasions-one-may-also-catch-a-very-rare-glimpse-of-not-one-but-a-double-halo-surrounding-the-sun">On rare occasions one may also catch a very rare glimpse of not one but a double halo surrounding the sun.</h3><p>This is special because while halos are beautiful no matter what extent these fully enclosed halos are slightly more rare since they require the perfect mixture of crystallized water vapor sunlight and flawless geometry. They are located approximately 22. It is reported that the solar halo is also called the circular rainbow which is a relatively rare atmospheric optical phenomenon. A Solar Halo occurs when fine ice particles are suspended in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight at a certain angle to the earth. While these halos are among the most common of the odd-radius halos they are rarely seen by one person.</p>
