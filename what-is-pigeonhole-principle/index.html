<p><strong>What Is Pigeonhole Principle</strong>, At first glance the pigeonhole principle also known as Dirichlets principle in honor of the eponymous German mathematician might appear to be too obvious to be useful. In mathematics there is simply a concept inspired by such pigeonholes known as pigeonhole principle which was introduced in 1834 by a German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. If Kn1 pigeons are kept in n pigeon holes where K is a positive integer what is the average no.</p>

A Pair of Socks Assume you have 10 orange socks and 10 blue socks and you want to find a matching pair of socks from a random pick. If more than n n n objects are placed into n n n boxes then at least one box must contain more than one object. At first glance the pigeonhole principle also known as Dirichlets principle in honor of the eponymous German mathematician might appear to be too obvious to be useful. The Pigeonhole Principle is a simple-sounding mathematical idea but it has a lot of various applications across a wide range of problems.</p>

<p>If Kn1 pigeons are kept in n pigeon holes where K is a positive integer what is the average no. The Pigeon-Hole Principle states that if p items Pigeons are put into h pigeonholes with ph then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one item.
