<p>Why did Master Chief fight Locke. If youre referring to a 1 on 1 fight the Master Chief would most likely win. As soon as Chief saw the device and realized Locke was an actual threat he Wiped the floor with Locke as I believe Buck put it in Halo. Who is stronger Master Chief vs agent Locke. Yes and by far.

<p>If youre referring to a 1 on 1 fight the Master Chief would most likely win. But in a 1v1 with a relatively open room Locke would probably win due to his superior armor and choice of weapon. As soon as Chief saw the device and realized Locke was an actual threat he Wiped the floor with Locke as I believe Buck put it in Halo. If youre referring to who the better character is thatd be Locke. Overall Chief wins this one. Think Locke R Halo.</p>
