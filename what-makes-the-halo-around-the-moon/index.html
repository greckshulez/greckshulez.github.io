<p>Halo optical phenomenon - Wikipedia 240 views View upvotes Answer requested by Rick Wilz Maxwell Plank Expert Problem Solver. A lunar halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. Moon halo is relatively large with the radius almost the size of an outstretched hand. They do this by refracting and reflecting the light.
