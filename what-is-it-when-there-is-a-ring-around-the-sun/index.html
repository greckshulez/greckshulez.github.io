Tiny ice crystals in Earths atmosphere cause the halos. They move and spin around Saturn at incredibly fast speeds and there are actually smaller rings that make up the larger rings. RIngs around the sun are caused by cirrus clouds &ndash; high altitude clouds that form above 30000 feet. A rainbow halo around the sun or moon is caused when the crystals refract the suns white light at a 22-degree angle toward Earth.</p>
