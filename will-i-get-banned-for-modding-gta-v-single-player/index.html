<p>Even altered rpf files will not get you banned. I now have two copies of the game I was falsely banned back in November - long story.

<p>Also moddinghacking GTAOnline is not supported here if that is the intention. Some mods install files directly into the game folders and are not easy to track down is what Im saying.

Its literally impossible to accidentally get banned from GTA V with single player mods. Here you can find all about Grand Theft Auto 5 Modding. The 10 Best Gta 5 Pc Mods So Far Techradar.</p>

<p>You can either run two separate copies of the game and NEVER go online with the story mode modded version or play your one copy in story mode and when youre done modding erase the game directory and re-install new for playing online. This was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications. It looks like people playing the single player portion of Grand Theft Auto on PC are getting banned too. But if Youll mod in Online Youll be playing with fire ban for 30 days at first time 60 days if You continue playing and also use mods Online and third time caught modding Online is giving You permanent ban. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing.
