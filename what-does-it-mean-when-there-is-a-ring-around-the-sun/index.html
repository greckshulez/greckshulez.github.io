<p>As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. Cirrostratus clouds are thin high-altitude clouds composed of ice crystals. See WW2010s website for diagrams that illustrate how it. A lunar halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Occasionally brighter areas will form along these halos creating a mock Sun or sundog Sundogs are known as parhelia or the singular parhelion to astronomers from the Greek words meaning beside the Sun.
