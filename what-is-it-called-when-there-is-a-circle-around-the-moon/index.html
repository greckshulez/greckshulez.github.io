<p>When visible around the Moon it is called a moon ring or winter halo. And on other nights you might not be able to see the Moon at all. They bear this name because the radius of the circle around the sun or moon is approximately 22 degrees. The halo appears large. This weather condition is a must to observe the phenomena.

Rings around the Moon are caused when moonlight passes through thin clouds of ice crystals high in Earths atmosphere. Often you can look up during a clear night and see a bright ring around the moon.
