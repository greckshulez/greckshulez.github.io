<h3 id="if-you-chose-add-server-on-step-3-give-the-server-a-name-and-click-done-then-double-click-on-the-server-from-your-list-or-select-it-and-choose-join-server">If you chose Add Server on step 3 give the server a name and click Done then double click on the server from your list or select it and choose Join Server.</h3><p>When you see a list named LAN World with your friends username and the world name double click it and select Join Server. The catch with this is that the world isnt stored on the a cloud-based service so it is only open until the host leaves the game while with Realms the world is open 247 so no host is required. Head to Friends and click on Join Realm. Select the Friends tab and choose Join Realm. Then join a Singleplayer world and invite those people that you want to play with.</p>
