Load times on the PS5 are better looks still looks the same to me since I been playing on an 8k TV for about a year the fps is still CAPed at 30fps performance is around the same but never had a PS4 so cant really compare it to that but I do have an Xbox series x and played on and Xbox x and other than the load screen and slightly different look still the same. Please say it does. 10 votes 10 comments. Its not the lightning-fast loading time youll get on many PlayStation 5 titles but its a solid boost nonetheless.

<p>The PS5 makes my old games even better. The only condition. Also it is recommended to deactivate some other running programs from the start-up section on your Task Manager. Please say it does.

<p>PS5 has better reflections. Black Desert on PS4 has. Thanks to the way the backwards compatibility is it will cap you at 30fps on 4k there hasnt been a patch from PA like there was for a couple other PS4 games. So if this was a fanboy bias post it kinda fell on its ass. Black Desert Online is a magnificent MMORPG developed by Korean company Pearl Abyss and published for PC in 2015.
