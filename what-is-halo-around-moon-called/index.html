It is formed when the moonlight is refracted in ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. A halo also called a nimbus is a geometric shape usually in the form of a disk circle ring or rayed structure. Known as a moon ring a winter halo or a 22-degree halo this optical phenomenon occurs when cirrus or cirrostratus clouds form high up in the atmosphere. I took this straight from Wikipedia.

<p>They are called 22-degree halos because the ring has a radius of approximately 22. A lunar halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Known as a moon ring a winter halo or a 22-degree halo its when ice crystals suspended high above in thin wispy cirrus clouds refract the moons light to form a perfect circle Meteorologist Drew Tuma says. APOD Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere. A halo around the sun or moon is caused by the refraction of that bodys light by ice crystals at high altitude. Here S What S Causing That Bright Ring Around The Moon.</p>
