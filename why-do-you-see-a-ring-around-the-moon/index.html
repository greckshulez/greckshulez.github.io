<p>You can also see a solar halo as well caused by the same cirrus cloud refraction and meaning the same thing source. Cirrus and cirrostratus clouds are often precursors for storm clouds behind them because they are most often the first cloud layer seen when a weather system approaches. Moonlight is bending in the way of light traveling through a lens after going through the ice crystals.</p>
<h3 id="the-amazing-phenomenon-occurs-when-light-from-the-moon-reflects-off-ice-crystals-in-the-atmosphere">The amazing phenomenon occurs when light from the moon reflects off ice crystals in the atmosphere.</h3><p>This ring surrounding the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight which is really reflected sunlight of course through ice crystals suspended in the upper atmosphere between 5-10 km in. A ring appearing around the moon is known as a lunar halo. Why does the moon have a ring around it. Corona are caused by water droplets diffracting the moons light they are fairly small and close to the moon. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter.</p>
