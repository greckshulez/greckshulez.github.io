Cirrus and cirrostratus clouds are often precursors for storm clouds behind them because they are most often the first cloud layer seen when a weather system approaches. Moonlight is bending in the way of light traveling through a lens after going through the ice crystals.</p>
<h3 id="the-amazing-phenomenon-occurs-when-light-from-the-moon-reflects-off-ice-crystals-in-the-atmosphere">The amazing phenomenon occurs when light from the moon reflects off ice crystals in the atmosphere.</h3><p>This ring surrounding the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight which is really reflected sunlight of course through ice crystals suspended in the upper atmosphere between 5-10 km in. A ring appearing around the moon is known as a lunar halo. Why does the moon have a ring around it. Corona are caused by water droplets diffracting the moons light they are fairly small and close to the moon. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter.</p>
