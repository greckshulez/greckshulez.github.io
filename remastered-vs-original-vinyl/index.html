<p>A sort of nice if over-hyped uber-detailed kind of sound overall. As for how you remaster an album the answer is. Hey guys I love vinyl and Zeppelin so I want to build on my vinyl collection with some great albums. Druboogie Mar 11 2014. Where things get interesting and maybe even controversial is when that same digital remastering is applied back to vinyl taking a recorded sound that was designed for analog converting it to one that was designed for CD and then applying it back to a format that was also designed for analog.

<p>Albums that were released before the mid 90s tended to be best as original release. The remastered 2009 mono mixes are quite excellent.

But the Mofi was comparatively more closed in sounding almost comparatively plain sounding at first. The sequencing difference is that delivery from mastering for digital is either individual WAV files for download or a single DDPi file for CD replication whereas for vinyl the delivery is generally two WAV files one for each side of the record.

<p>DONT FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE. But the Mofi was comparatively more closed in sounding almost comparatively plain sounding at first. Compared to the Ed1 vinyl 1987 the Ed2 Vinyl 2016 seems less dynamic than the original vinyl version cf track Yet Another Movie Round And Around DR12 vs DR14. The originals have better dynamic range which means less compression which almost always means better sound quality but like you said the originals are also much more expensive. Record companies are precious with original tapes so to avoid the master eroding usually everything is transferred to digital format at high resolution ideally 24bit192khz.

<p>The originals have better dynamic range which means less compression which almost always means better sound quality but like you said the originals are also much more expensive. All CDs created from analog sources are. CDs re-mastered in the mid-1990s to the present day tend to be a mixed bag some. The variances could be from the sourcing of the masters the packaging and even the thickness and type of vinyl used. Compared to the Ed1 vinyl 1987 the Ed2 Vinyl 2016 seems less dynamic than the original vinyl version cf track Yet Another Movie Round And Around DR12 vs DR14.

<p>Ten VINYL by Pearl Jam Vinyl 1899. Where things get interesting and maybe even controversial is when that same digital remastering is applied back to vinyl taking a recorded sound that was designed for analog converting it to one that was designed for CD and then applying it back to a format that was also designed for analog. For the old original stuff and then noticed I could get the new remastered vinyl for around the same. Ive been looking on eBay etc. The consensus appears to be that only some cds vinyl tend to sound better after remastering while others are best listened to as original recordings due to the loudness war and what not.

<p>Evan On some tracks on IV I prefer the remaster MMH and GTC for example even with the unforgivable early fades. As for how you remaster an album the answer is. Waveform Ed2 vinyl remastered 2016 Compared to the Ed1 vinyl 1987 and Ed2 CD 1987 the Streaming Amazon Music remastered 2011 Ed4 and the Qobuz Remastered in 2011 is a bit compressed. If you can find an original that is not warped or heavily scratched for under 90 then I would say absolutely go for it. Without forgetting that one is pressed on analog sound original master into a analog support vinyl support and the other is pressed on digital sound remastered into a analog support same vinyl support.
