<p>He spent the next few years on the mainland and though he failed to kill Widmores daughter as promised he eliminated much of the mans organization using Sayid a survivor who escaped. Ben killed Locke because he knew that Eloise could send Locke back to the Island. Ben knew if Locke got to Eloise then hed be able to get back and reclaim leadership of the island so Ben kills him and takes his place in getting the others back to the island through Eloise. Hes been privy to this role for longer. Ben was obviously jealous of him shot him and left him for dead. Darby Stanchfield Martin Roach In Locke Key Locke Key Black Doors Tv Series.</p>
