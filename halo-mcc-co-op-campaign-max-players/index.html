<p>Halo 1 Posted by uCasualRedditer678954 2 years ago MCC CE Campaign Co-op is 2 Player Only Explain why in the age of the internet when we no longer have to coax a neighbor or family member to play co-op with can we not play co-op with more than a Split-Screen couch count. Halo 2 supports two player online co-op on PC. I dont recall 4 player co-op being a thing in any of the campaigns nor do i recall 2 player co-op on CEHalo 1 was single player campaign if i recall only Halo CE was at least 2 player split-screen at least and if you are all on different consoles you can do 4 players. Reach 4 players max online. Me and 3 other friends really want to play the campaign together. Halo The Master Chief Collection Game Halopedia The Halo Wiki.</p>
