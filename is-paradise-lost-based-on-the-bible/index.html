<p>For instance God and Satan stand as complete opposites. God created Adam and Eve perfect with the prospect of living forever in Paradise. Paradise Lost is generally agreed to be our greatest epic even the greatest work of literature written in the English language. As much as anything it ultimately expresses Miltons personal truth by presenting the fundamentals of christian theology. In the Bible we are given the creation story followed by the story of Adam and Eve and their fall from grace. Lucifer Cast Out By Gusave Dore Gustave Dore Paul Gustave Dore Fallen Angel.</p>

<p>This paper focuses only on Book 1 of Miltons Paradise Lost in order to describe how the fallen angels are depicted in the poem and what they represent today. John Miltons Paradise Lost attempts to justify Gods will by giving a better understanding of the ways of God according to the author. It is theological fiction instead of historical fiction. Paradise Lost is a work of fiction and the author John Milton an English Puritan used different version of the Bible as the basis for his research.

<p>Paradise Lost is a work of fiction and the author John Milton an English Puritan used different version of the Bible as the basis for his research. In the Bible we are given the creation story followed by the story of Adam and Eve and their fall from grace. Beginning with the fall from Eden and the nature of evil to the means of regaining. Given this it is rather strange to find a benign strain of criticism which denies the very Englishness of this epic. Adam and Eve thereby lost perfection and severed their relationship with the Source of life Jehovah. Paradise Lost Book Cover Google Images John Milton Paradise Lost Book Milton.</p>
