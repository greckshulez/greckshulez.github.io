<p>A lunar halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Sometimes the cirrus is so thin we are not aware of any cloud in the sky. Lunar halos are quite rare and occur most often during the winter months.</p>

<p>A lunar halo goes by many different names. A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light typically from the Sun or Moon interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The refraction and reflection of the moonlight off the ice crystals creates a halo with an apparent radius of approximately 22 degrees around the moon. The light rays coming from the sun that are then reflected on the moon are bent by the crystals 22 away from the moon. Learn what causes it and when to spot one in the night sky.
