<p>Thats why I told you earlier to keep the rocket. In any case the point of the legendary ending is that there are more Halo. In Halo 1 the random jump leads the Pillar to discover the first Halo Ring. You also get an attachment if youve completed Halo 3. As someone who recently went through and beat every campaign in the MCC in preparation for Halo 5 Ill start off by saying that Halo 5s campaign was Halo through and through and in my opinion it is the most epic sci-fi adventure in the Halo series Not necessarily my favorite but epic as fuck nonetheless.

<p>Halo 3 ending complete beaten on legendary and properly ripped with a TV tuner card. 1 is easiest 10 is hardest Pillar of Autumn - b2b Spam grenades at every opportunity and use noob combo well and this is easy Halo - b7b Any part without the sniper rifle is literally hell is pretty cool with the sniper Truth and Reconciliation - b9b Similar to two betrayals in that it relentlessly throws major and gold elites and jackals at you sniper noob combo is good here. You also get an attachment if youve completed Halo 3. Guardians feature such endings. Six ends up sacrificing himself however as he is overwhelmed by Covenant forces.
