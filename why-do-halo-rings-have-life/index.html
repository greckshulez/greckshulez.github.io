<p>A halo from the Greek á¼Î»ÏÏ halÅs. It has been used in the iconography of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures and has at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes. All that glitter meansa lot of maintenance. When fired they kill all sentient life in the galaxy capable of falling prey to the Flood thereby starving the parasite of its food. Rings had seed vaults of life on them essentially to be used for reseeding the galaxy with organic life after the flood were wiped out.
