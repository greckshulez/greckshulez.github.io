<p>As someone who enjoys all the halo games quite a bit I felt slightly disappointed by the story and game overall. Co-Op Campaign should release with more content added to the campaign Feedback It was unfortunate to find out that co-op is delayed for campaign but I think it would be a missed opportunity to not include more content in the campaign along with the launch of co-op campaign as that would give people who already played the campaign a reason to jump back in again. Infinite has zero co-op until May at the very earliest. It just downright sad that they would advertise Infinite as having 4 player split screen then make you pay 60 for just the campaign only for that component to not even have the split screen.
