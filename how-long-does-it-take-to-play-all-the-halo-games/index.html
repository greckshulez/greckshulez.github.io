<p>I just looked up how long to play all the halo games and it says about 24-32 hours 6-8 hours per game playing through 1-4 if you havent memorized every level on normal difficulty and are watching cutscenes. The Halo franchise contains a massive story that stretches out across multiple games. Here is the list of how the Halo games were originally released though you can find the same timeline order or list on Wikipedia as well I am adding this list for easier understanding of the difference between Halo original release and series chronology. Then add anywhere from another 18-24 hours for the other 3 games as this says only 1-4 so they dont include Reach 5 and Halo 3 ODST which is a shorter game so take. Doesnt matter too much.
