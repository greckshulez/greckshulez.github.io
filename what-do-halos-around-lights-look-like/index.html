<p>Light is made up of different colors but because the rays focus on a single point you cant distinguish them. Let your eye doctor or an ophthalmologist know if you suddenly start seeing halos especially if they are accompanied by pain redness blurred vision or any other major symptoms. Halos around lights are most noticeable at night or when youre in dim or dark areas.
