<p>So Wally was not sucked into the Speed Force. Season 3 of Young Justice found Artemis sharing a house in Star City with Will Harper and her niece Lian. Wally sighed heavily groaned and said Ive actually never counted the blows I just try desperately wait for it to be over Im sorry for the way I phrased the question Bruce said softly leaning back in his chair and folding his. They would only be given access to the Leagues public office and not the actual headquarters. Invasion Artemis has struggled to move on with her life.

<p>The fact is Wally didnt die because he helped Barry and Bart he died because he was too slow to get the job done without getting killed. While Wally didnt fall in love with Linda on Young Justice one of his last thoughts before disappearing in Season 2 was about Artemis. What was perhaps most memorable about Wallys sacrifice is that it did not come in battle against a huge villain but rather in the course of stopping the Reachs schemes. His return to Young Justice will undoubtedly get fans excited and hopeful for a surprise return and resurrection for Wally West as well. Wally West was dead.
