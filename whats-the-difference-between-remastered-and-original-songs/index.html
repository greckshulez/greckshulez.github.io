<p>But we actually are both in agreement on the overall principle involved. Remastering usually involves enhancing. Answer 1 of 4. Mastering engineers usually have decades of experience in the recording business and an exquisitely trained ear. Using the original master source material.

<p>We loosely refer to RS 2014 Remastered as RS 2014. What this does is destroy the original mix that was created in the original mixing studio because now the cymbals kick drum and bass guitar are all louder than they were in the original mix. Using the original master source material. A remaster means adjusting the quality of the individual tracks on the original song in an attempt to improve it but the original structure of the song stays intact. You often see remastered from the original multitrack or something like that.

<p>Its a different version. A remaster should not change the artistic vision of the recording artist and producer. When too many copies have been made the master begins to wear out. Id say the former is generally better for storytelling while the latter is better for more tense moments and combat. In other words its still the same song just hopefully better sounding.
