<p>Having a cross-play ability adds quite a bit to the versatility of the game. Please check out all the details on the games official website. You can also cross-play with the PC though only with players using the Windows store. Ive been through loads of threads speaking about the questions whether the game is cross-platform between Steam and PC Game pass but no one got the answer. Welcome to the official community-driven subreddit for Remnant. Does Remnant From The Ashes Have Crossplay Isk Mogul Adventures.</p>
