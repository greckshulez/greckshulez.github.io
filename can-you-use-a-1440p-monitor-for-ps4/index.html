Question About Lack Of Blurriness On 1440p Monitor R Ps4pro From reddit.com</p>
<p>First of all it comes with an IPS display panel even with 1440p resolution and a 270 Hz refresh rate. I have a 1440p monitor for my PC but I cant do a console test since it only accepts DVI and I dont have a converter. That not the issue it the system itself.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-you-can-find-something-you-can-stand">Maybe you can find something you can stand.</h3><p>Hdmi does not support all monitor resolutions. Theres no reason why the PS4 couldnt output at that but I guess Sony want you to buy their Bravia TVs instead of a monitor whereas Xbox are just doing a bit of fan service. I havent even hooked it up to my 1440p monitor yet. And it seems your monitor has lousy 1080p upscaling. Or the monitor might be able to scale the 4k signal to 1440p.</p>

<p>Worst of both worlds. First of all it comes with an IPS display panel even with 1440p resolution and a 270 Hz refresh rate. Im having plan for buying second hand ps4 slimpro for fifa 21 this year. You can find both 4k monitors for the PS4 Pro or 1080p options if you have the standard PS4. Maybe you can find something you can stand. Best 1440p Monitors Techradar.</p>

<p>Theres no reason why the PS4 couldnt output at that but I guess Sony want you to buy their Bravia TVs instead of a monitor whereas Xbox are just doing a bit of fan service. The XBX does will. The dashboard is still rendered at 1080p but any Xbox One X-enhanced games will display in native 1440p. Looks exactly the same 14 comments 50 Upvoted This thread is archived. I recently got a PS4 Slim and while I was doing my research about the right display for it in multiple threads here on reddit and elsewhere Ive read that connecting a PS4 to a 1440p display would result in bad stretched out images and 1080p native is preferred.

<p>A PS4 will work on a 1440 P monitor but the PS4 either outputs most games in 4K or 1080 P depending on the graphics settings that you chose. If you play the PS4 Pro on a 1440p monitor then the display might be a little blurry and may lack sharpness as it does not natively support the 1440p and is just upscaling the HD1080p content into 1440p content. PS4 doesnt support 1440p or 144hz so its not the ideal place to play games on but the PS4 Pro will work just fine at 1080p and 60hz on that monitor.

<p>Theres no reason why the PS4 couldnt output at that but I guess Sony want you to buy their Bravia TVs instead of a monitor whereas Xbox are just doing a bit of fan service. But you will get more input lag from not sending a native 1440p and 144hz signal to the monitor if you dont play any competitive games then you will be fine and likely wont notice it.

I have a 1440p monitor for my PC but I cant do a console test since it only accepts DVI and I dont have a converter. The Ps5 Does Not Support Native 1440p Output According To Sony.</p>

<p>1440p is a different pixel ratio than 1080p so yes 1080p will look crappy on a 1440p monitor. If youre only using it for your PS4 then it makes zero sense to get a 1440p monitor. You would have to go with 1080p but it will not see you have 1440p and scale up. Probably not all monitors but the Asus VG27BQ works perfectly.
