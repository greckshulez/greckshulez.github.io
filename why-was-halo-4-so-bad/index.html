<p>I mean the campaign held no comparison to h3 reach or any of the previous games. Halo 4 had a fantastic campaign story but the core mechanics of the game were bad. When Halo 4 released in 2012 Spartan Ops was the game mode that replaced the Halo 3 ODST and Halo Reach Firefight mode. Why is this not accpetable in 4 but its not acceptable in CE especially since as the first game of the series the player had no prior context to it so giving extra context would have been even more important.

<p>Also it kind of ruins the point of it being an arena shooter if starts arent even. As expected the launch hasnt come without a couple of issues. The story isnt creative to me at all it sticks to so many tropes it forgets that the game is even halo. Reach had unbalanced AAs slow boring gameplay no MP maps shipped with the game as they were all from campaign or Forge World and a lot of the weapons were incredibly unbalanced all of the Covenant weapons were garbage. The way they developed the games in my personal opinion is not great bordering on completely unacceptable. Halo 4 All Cutscenes In 4k 60fps Youtube.</p>
