<p>If you factor in consistency with the prequels the changes to Boba Fett in ESB and Anakin in RoTJ make all six films more consistent too. Perhaps the most egregious changes were to the 1977 original itself which because of Lucass prequel plans would later be re-labeled as Star Wars Episode IV. Now the Botany Bay in the episode Space Seed with its blurry textures looks straight out of an N64 game.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-starcraft-remastered-offers-upgraded-graphics">The new StarCraft Remastered offers upgraded graphics.</h3><p>In fairness the films. The original trilogy is re-released on LaserDisc with what in hindsight is the highly inaccurate claim to be definitive. The Emperor is the same actor in ESB and RoTJ for example. That said I prefer the originals. If you factor in consistency with the prequels the changes to Boba Fett in ESB and Anakin in RoTJ make all six films more consistent too.</p>
