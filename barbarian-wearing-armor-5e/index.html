<p>Unarmored Defense allows an extra advantage to my naked barbarian. Can barbarians wear heavy armor 5e. It only kind of makes sense to go unarmored earlier because of fast movement but barbarians only need to get close enough to hit the enemy. Fast Movement Starting at 5th level your speed increases by 10 feet while you arent wearing heavy armor. 12 level 2 deleted 6y you can just take so many hits you dont care.

<p>Theres no reason why a barbarian shouldnt wear medium armor if it would increase their AC. Again as shields are not armor you can wield it with the Unarmored Defense class feature. Feral Instinct By 7th level your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. This class is all about taking and dishing out tons of damage which the barbarians core abilities like Rage support by giving them resistance to damage extra attack damage and a massive pool of hit. Battle master fighterBear totem barbarian would be able to wear plate armor with a shield and the deffensive fighting style to gain a AC of 21 take half damage on everything but psychic and be immune to fear and charm effects.

<p>Raging as a Barbarian using the Unarmored Defense class feature could bolster the tankiness of your character and really get in the thick of things. Dont be discouraged by not wearing armor. Now on the general rules for barbarian rage it says. Can barbarians wear plate armor. Beginning at 5th level you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
