<p>Halos around the sun are caused by the refraction or the splitting of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. How is it formed. It takes the form of a ring with a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the sun or the moon.</p>

A Sun halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Sundogs are colored spots of light that develop due to the refraction of light through ice crystals. The rare optical phenomenon forms a ring around the sun which occurs when the light gets refracted through suspended ice crystals in the atmosphere. Halos are rings of light that can encircle the sun or the moon and they usually occur when a thin layer of cirrus clouds are present in the sky.</p>

However as it passes in front of the sun refraction of the light by the ice crystals causes the halo to form. These crystals begin to act as prisms that refract light. These clouds are characterized as thin and wispy strands of ice that form in the cold region of the atmosphere typically at around 18000-21000 feet or more above the surface of the planet.

<p>Halo is produced when light from either the sun or moon interacts with ice crystal suspended in the atmosphere. Typically sunlight or moonlight is reflected by ice crystals producing a white halo. The rare optical phenomenon forms a ring around the sun which occurs when the light gets refracted through suspended ice crystals in the atmosphere. A halo which is also referred to as a gloriole nimbus or icebow is an optical phenomenon generated by light interaction with suspended ice crystals in the atmosphere which results in a wide variety of white or colored spots arcs and rings in the sky.

Halos around the sun are caused by the refraction or the splitting of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. The sunlight refracts through the ice at a 22 degree angle creating the halo effect. Halos can also form around artificial lights in very cool weather when ice crystals are floating in the air.

<p>It is as a result of sunlight traveling. Halos range from colored to arcs and spots in the sky near the sun or the moon. Halos are rings of light that can encircle the sun or the moon and they usually occur when a thin layer of cirrus clouds are present in the sky. However as it passes in front of the sun refraction of the light by the ice crystals causes the halo to form.

<p>What Causes Sun Halos. A halo which is also referred to as a gloriole nimbus or icebow is an optical phenomenon generated by light interaction with suspended ice crystals in the atmosphere which results in a wide variety of white or colored spots arcs and rings in the sky. It is formed by cirrus clouds which are thin detached hair-like clouds. The rare optical phenomenon forms a ring around the sun which occurs when the light gets refracted through suspended ice crystals in the atmosphere. Ice crystals become suspended in cirrus clouds.

<p>However as it passes in front of the sun refraction of the light by the ice crystals causes the halo to form. It is as a result of sunlight traveling. Sun halo also known as 22 degree halo is an optical phenomenon that occurs due to sunlight refracting in millions of hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Typically sunlight or moonlight is reflected by ice crystals producing a white halo. These clouds are characterized as thin and wispy strands of ice that form in the cold region of the atmosphere typically at around 18000-21000 feet or more above the surface of the planet.

<p>A mix of chemistry physics. Clouds contain millions of ice crystals which refract split and even reflect the light to give an impression of a circular rainbow ring. Everyone sees their own particular halo made by their own particular ice crystals which are different from the ice crystals making the halo of. The sunlight refracts through the ice at a 22 degree angle creating the halo effect. This leads to the formation of a halo of around 22-degrees around the sun.
