<p>Throw down a Drop Wall for them if you can then use the Grappleshot to get away from them. I hope these tips will help you guys. I never got past this part on the Xbox version either.</p>
<h3 id="almost-all-sentinels-have-shields-including-allied-ones">Almost all Sentinels have shields including allied ones.</h3><p>You can beat the mission in something like 3-5 minutes. Use them as a distraction to get shots off on the Hunters backs. For Brutes put some shots on their head some spawn with a helmet and their eponymous grenade launcher so you need to put some in their helmet for breaking it and then headshot them. I just got done playing through on legendary for 8 hours got up to mission 10 lol and can confirm that the white elites take exactly 4 sniper headshots to kill which I found is the most efficient way to kill them other than running them over. I hope these tips will help you guys.</p>
