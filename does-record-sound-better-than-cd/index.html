<p>You should connect the emotiva to the schiit and compare how it sounds versus the imac as a transport. I must admit when CDs first hit the market back in the 80s they churned out loads of older material on the format and they did a pretty bad rush job of it all just to make money there was no way 99 of that stuff churned out back then sounded better than the original vinyl albums I already had and they sounded pretty naff in comparison to them but the newer. When I render a mix down to CD quality from 9624 tracks and listen to the rendered mix I end up wishing that 9624 was the typical resolution for music delivery. Vinyl fans will argue that as it is an end-to-end analogue format from the recording and pressing to playback that it more closely reproduces what the artist originally played in the studio. Music pressed onto a record will have a closer representation to the original sound-wave from the recording.
