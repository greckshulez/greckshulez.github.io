<p>The problem is programs like xpadder cant get Skyrim to use one or both analog joysticks AND keyboard and mouse. Its feels very smooth using the mouse in first person which is how I spend 90 of my time. You can follow these steps below to manually disable gamepad input for Skyrim. Its common in officelcomputer chairs and long flights. I prefer a controller as the interface seems to have been designed to be used with a controller.

<p>Its pure preference though I will say I dont think Ill go back to controller lol. You can die from being in the same position for a long time you know- happened to a girl once that I saw. Melee fighting is just as easy with the controller. The controller does have. The menus and general controls just feel more natural with the controller no doubt as.
