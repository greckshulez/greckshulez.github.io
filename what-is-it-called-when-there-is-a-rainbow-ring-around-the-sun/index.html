<p>Cirrostratus clouds are thin high-altitude clouds composed of ice crystals. A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Also known as a 22 degree halo or a sun halo the ring is caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the Earths atmosphere the University of Illinois Weather World Project 2010 explains. The prism effect of light passing through these six-sided ice crystals separates the light into its various colors resulting in a halo tinged with very pale rainbow colors with red on the inside and blue on the outside. This also means the rings have a radius of about 22 degrees around the moon or sun That is why this occurrence is also referred to as 22-degree halos by scientists and meteorologists.

<p>Among the best known halo types are the circular halo light pillars. Scientists call them 22-degree halos. But what about those times when you see a rainbow-like halo around the sun or moon. A ring of rainbow forms around the Sun through a phenomenon called Halo that happens because of light interacting with ice crystals in the atmosphere. Many of these appear near the Sun or Moon but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky.

<p>A halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere. Its the same physics really. A sign from the angels when you see a rainbow around the moon or the sun it is a sign that the Celestial Beings are around you. The halos you see are caused by both refraction or splitting of light and also.

<p>If you tried to contact them then it is their response to your call. The phenomenon of a lunar halo is similar to a rainbow produced by sunlight and rain falling between your eye and the sun. The prism effect of light passing through these six-sided ice crystals separates the light into its various colors resulting in a halo tinged with very pale rainbow colors with red on the inside and blue on the outside. It is called a halo and these are very common when we have high cirrus clouds in the atmosphere. The sun was surrounded by an extraordinarily bright rainbow-colored halo.
