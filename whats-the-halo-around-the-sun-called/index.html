<p>It is typically caused when there are very high very thin clouds. Also known as a 22 degree halo or a sun halo the ring is caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the Earths atmosphere the University of Illinois Weather World Project 2010 explains. Since high clouds typically proceed unsettled weather it is said a halo around the sun or moon means rain or snow is on the way. Its a solid radiation looking Halo that surrounds the entire body of a saint mainly that of Our Lady and is an almond-shaped depiction.
