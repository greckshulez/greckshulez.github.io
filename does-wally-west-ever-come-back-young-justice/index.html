<p>Outsiders panel at Comic-Con International in San Diego. I have been hoping like everyone else for quite some time that Wally will return in a similar fashion to Barry Allen when he was trapped in the Speed Force. Young Justice Season 4 could see the Team fall apart over Zatanna and Mgann faking Artemis encounter with Wallys ghost. Outsiders as the voice of new character Forager. However he learned alongside the other sidekicks that full membership into the League was not on the table.

Young Justice has been renewed for Season 4 after all. Barry Allen in the Young Justice universe met Jay Garrick around 1999 and started his own career in the year 2000. At the beginning of the chapter everyone thought that wally was really dead but before the end of the chapter it was revealed that everything Artemis saw was an illusion cast by mgann and zatanna for me that is To give hope that Wally is still alive what I want to get to is that if a producer of a series decides to kill a character in his series the producer decides that he will.
