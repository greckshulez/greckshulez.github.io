<p>In the trailer for Season 3 there are a few portals opening So my guess is Wally might come through the speed force portal which is a common thing in The Flash TV show XD. But when it comes to the Speed Force nothing is an exact science and the possibility remains entirely open that Wally could return. Now that Young Justice has been renewed for a third season fans will finally find out and Spisaks tweet means things are looking good. A hyper-active 15-year-old speedster he was always. Wally has appeared in Season 3 but only via hallucination even if he is still on the minds of his teammates.

<p>Wally has appeared in Season 3 but only via hallucination even if he is still on the minds of his teammates. Season 3 of Young Justice opened with an embittered Justice League seemingly breaking up with Batman leading a number of heroes to form their own independent team which Black Lightning sarcastically dubbed Batman Inc that would be able to act independently of the bureaucracy demanded by the United Nations. Wally West was the Teams resident class clown and goof-ball. How do you think Wally will come back in Young Justice. Outsiders but will he come back for Young Justice Season 4.
