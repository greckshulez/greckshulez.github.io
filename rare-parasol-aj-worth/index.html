<p><strong>Rare Parasol Aj Worth</strong>, Rare Item Monday is a weekly event introduced on November 7 2016 where every Monday a rare version of a released item is sold in one of the shops for only one day. The Flower Umbrella is a clothing item worn on the back. Originally it is worth around 60k however I would say that it is worth way more than that since it probably wont be coming back for sale next year as there was a new 2020 version instead of just putting the old one back one sale suggesting that it wont come back.</p>
