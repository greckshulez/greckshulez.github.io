<p>Its a cash grab Gameboy game meant to tie into Symphony because of Alucard. Theres really no reason why this game isnt canon. The game was conceived as a prequel to all other games in the Castlevania series.</p>
<h3 id="castlevania-legends-is-not-canon-to-the-castlevania-storyline">Castlevania Legends is not canon to the Castlevania storyline.</h3><p>The only woman Alucard had was Maria Sonya or even her son with Alucard was never mentioned in the series. The only woman Alucard had was Maria Sonya or even her son with Alucard was never mentioned in the series. Not entirely true - Legends is supposed to happen in 1450 and there was never an official date given for Lisas death at least not until IGA decided to retcon games and came out with an official Castlevania timeline Japanese version here which only says that Lisa died sometime around the 1470s. Castlevania Legends is the third Castlevania title released for the original Game Boy. But yeah Konami decanonized Legends because they were afraid of having a story where the female protagonist doesnt fuck a male supportive character.</p>

Despite being either unofficially or officially removed from the timeline Castlevania Legends exists just as much as any of the Konami Kobe games.

<p>It was released in Japan on November 27 1997 and in Europe and North America on March 11 1998. Legit all you need to do is get rid of the detail that the Clan started with her. A straight-forward reason for removing Legends from series canon is that its story makes no sense. All your other vanias have sucked ass. Castlevania Legends cant be blamed for not adhering to the IGA canon at that point because IGA was a relative nobody back then and his canon hadnt been set yet.

<p>Its much like how DisneyLucas middle fingered like 30 years of Star Wars books calling them non-canon theyd never support and pretend dont exist unless they choose to add them to their legends line of books. Legends is completely irrelevant plus in order to canonize Legends we would have to exclude not only Lament of Innocence but Castlevania III Symphony of The Night and the radio Drama Nocturne of Recollection. Her story was intended to elaborate on the origins of the entire Castlevania series as well as the feud between the Belmont Clan and Count Dracula. Simply having a female Belmont does not seem like a reason Legends has been written out of the Castlevania series.

<p>But Castlevania Legends made by a rival team in Nagoya was specifically excluded. Castlevania Legends is the third Castlevania title released for the original Game Boy. But Castlevania Legends made by a rival team in Nagoya was specifically excluded. Which is only two decades removed from 1450 really. Not being canon or not isnt that big of a deal but its not like it actually hurt the rest of the games because Alucard is implied to be Trevors father.

<p>The story follows Sonia Belmont a vampire hunter. But hey Iga isnt involved in the series so his idea as to what is or isnt canon is meaningless. Its much like how DisneyLucas middle fingered like 30 years of Star Wars books calling them non-canon theyd never support and pretend dont exist unless they choose to add them to their legends line of books. Not because of its quality it could have been great and it still wouldnt be canon. Legends heavily implies that Sonia Belmont has a child with Alucard which would make the future Belmont clan descended from.

<p>The game was conceived as a prequel to all other games in the Castlevania series. For the Lords of Shadow timeline see Lords of Shadow Timeline. The only woman Alucard had was Maria Sonya or even her son with Alucard was never mentioned in the series. Not entirely true - Legends is supposed to happen in 1450 and there was never an official date given for Lisas death at least not until IGA decided to retcon games and came out with an official Castlevania timeline Japanese version here which only says that Lisa died sometime around the 1470s. But Castlevania Legends made by a rival team in Nagoya was specifically excluded.

The he hated CotM because he didnt work on it argument only gained more traction and morphed into its not canon because IGA didnt work on it.

Nah legends existence contradicts almost everything estabilished in the original universe alucard being trevor father the belmonts being half vampires dracula transformation into the dark lord dracula and alucard back story the entirety of castlevania 3 and im not even counting lament of innocence or the games that came after legends and to be fair legends is a pretty shitty game. The timeline was intended to be a reference for the developers of Symphony of the Night but was accidentally leaked. Not because of its quality it could have been great and it still wouldnt be canon.
