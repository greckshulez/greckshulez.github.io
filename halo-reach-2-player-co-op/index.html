<p>Halo 3 is shipped with the ability to launch two-player Co-op mode on Local Play. I would like to know where the 4 player split-screen is at for campaign and firefight. Been trying to do a Co-op legendary Run with my Buddy as he is somewhat new to Halo have been able to play every halo game in MCC without it disconnecting including CE and Reach but when we launch Halo 2 it will be somewhat fine before Crashing to Main menu. First of all you will need to log in to two profiles on Local Play. No on CE though which is sad its my favorite Halo. Halo Campaigns Are Best Played In Co Op Polygon.</p>

<p>They were all 2 player via split screen the 4 player in 3odstreach and 4 was enabled via system link or internet play. However it is possible to log a person in to a Local Play game just before the game starts. Halo 2 Co-OP campaign Disconnects to Main menu on Xbox and Refuses to Load levels on PC. They can be either temporary profiles or gamertags signed into Xbox. I dont recall 4 player co-op being a thing in any of the campaigns nor do i recall 2 player co-op on CEHalo 1 was single player campaign if i recall only Halo CE was at least 2 player split-screen at least and if you are all on different consoles you can do 4 players.
