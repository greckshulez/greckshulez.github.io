<p>Since halos are found nowhere in. John 655-59 ESV 8 helpful votesNot Helpful. The Bible does not speak of halos or auras but it does speak of light in many places especially of Jesus Christ as the light of the world John 812 and of Satan as one who can disguise himself as an angel of light 2 Corinthians 1114.

<p>In fact halos are found nowhere in the Bible. Revelation 101 Those ice filled cirrus clouds that form Sun Halos can look like the ribbons and folds of a white robe and fiery light pillars can also be formed by the presence of these ice crystals when the sun is near the horizon. A halo also called a nimbus is a geometric shape usually in the form of a disk circle ring or rayed structure. However He does speak more about joy than about happiness.
